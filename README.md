# Adolescents exhibit reduced Pavlovian biases on instrumental learning
Data and analysis code for: Raab, HA & Hartley CA. (2020). Adolescents exhibit reduced Pavlovian biases on instrumental learning. *Scientific Reports*. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72628-w

## Data
Data from the task and ages of participants can be found under ```Pav_bias/data/raw_data``` and computational model fits from the best fitting model can be found under ```Pav_bias/data/computational_model_fits```. 

## Analysis code 
Code to reproduce analyses and figures in the paper can be found in ```Pav_bias/analysis_code/```. R was used for behavioral analyses and all figures, and can be found under ```behavioral_analysis_code```. Matlab was used to fit computational models to the data, and this code can be found under ```computational_modeling_code```.
